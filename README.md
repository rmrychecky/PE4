Our code runs a small tic tac toe game in which players are prompted for a row and column choice in which they want to place one of their markers. The game assumes fair play so it goes on for 9 turns. In order to run the code, you use the command line prompt: g++ -std=c++17 -Wall TicTacToe.cpp -o file. This creates the executable, in order to run this executable, you will then use the command line prompt: ./file.
